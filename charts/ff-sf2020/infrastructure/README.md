# Top Speed Infrastructure

There is no application code to deploy, just Ververica Platform resources to support the
other applications.

This includes:
* A [Ververica Platform Namespace](https://docs.ververica.com/administration/namespaces.html)
for all the applications.
* A [Ververica Platform Deployment Target](https://docs.ververica.com/administration/deployment_targets.html)
that helps generalize some of the configuration for High Availability.

For values, see [`values.yaml`](./values.yaml).
